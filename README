This data set was extracted from filmeval/NED, a web app for 
managing newspaper digitization and microfilming.

Kopana Terry and Kathryn Lybarger at the University of Kentucky 
produced this data set based on the print Ayer's guide.

I dumped the data set in the hopes that someone else will find
it useful.
